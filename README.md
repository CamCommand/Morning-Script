# Morning-Script
Just a small python program that opens all the tabs I would on any given morning for news and looking for a job.

Make sure you have Python installed and either run:
  python Morning.py 
In your command line.
Or keep it on your Desktop and click it when you log on.
Inside are just website I like to keep an eye on, feel free to edit in Notepad++ and add or change what you use.
